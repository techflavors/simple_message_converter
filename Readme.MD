# Simple Message or Object Converter

There are many components available to convert an object of type A to type B. Most of these converters are either runtime or generates codes. The converters are configured using some configuration or mapping files. These components are good and easy for simple object conversion, but when it comes to complex object, we write complex mappings or configurations.

The biggest problem I have seen in such component is, if some value is not properly converted, it is difficult to debug and fix it, unless you are expert in using such component.

Here I am introducing a simple conversion component, which let developers to write conversion Java in simple way. 

## Getting Started

Refer to [test classes](https://github.com/tehflavors/simple-message-converters/tree/master/src/test/java/com/ak2006/myproject/rest/convertors/test) on how to use these components. These components can be used with & without Dependency Injection Framework.
